App that makes the job application process much easier. In CoCo, both applicants and employers create personal profiles and who they are and what they are looking for. Based on this, CoCo's algorithm automatically matches similar profiles with each other. Then, from there, employers can view their matches, and easily message or request an interview with the applicant. CoCo has both a sign-in system and an internal message system, allowing the whole job application process to conveniently take place within CoCo! CoCo was created with C++ with the users' data being saved by using and editing JSON files!
